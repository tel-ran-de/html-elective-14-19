1.these tags <dl> <dt> <dd> are for creating a list of definitions;
<dl> means description list
<dt> means description term
<dd> means description definition

3. preferably use <h1> only once per page.
Two <h1>  will mislead the internet search engine.
However, I read that this is not a very critical error
if we have two logical blocks on the page with their own headers.

4.Tag <main> highlights the main content of the page, which is not repeated on other pages.
And we use usually on the page  one <main> tag.

5.Tag <article sets the content of the site like news, article, blog post, forum, etc.
We can use several tag <article> on the page

6. The <strong> tag defines the importance of the marked text.
The <b> tag is designed to highlight text without giving it any special importance.
Visually, both tags are the same, they make the text bold.
